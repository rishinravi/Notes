### Play the stock market

Not for the faint hearted. Its not something a stock advisor would recommend for the amateurs. But, if learned well, it is a way where you can quickly, within hours make a significant amount of real money with1 relatively small investment.

>What are General market and penny stocks?

Market makers often move stocks to play into our fear of failure or our greed. Analyzing all the market forces is very crucial for success in day trading.

>Pay attention to moving average. Often when stocks break through 200-day moving averages, there's a potential for either a large upside or a big downside.

### Invest in money-making course
Investing in yourself is one of the best possible investments you can make. While you might not be able to pinpoint an actualized return on investment, there's no money that's better spent. Invest in yourself. Invest in your education. Learn. Adapt. Grow. Discover what you're passionate about.

There are loads of money-making courses on the internet. The hard part is choosing the right online course for you. From ebooks to affiliate marketing, search engine optimization and beyond, the possibilities are endless. While many money-making gurus might pop up on social media, not all courses are created alike. Spend time doing your due diligence and research to choose the one that's right for you.

###  Trade commodities
Trading commodities like gold and silver present a rare opportunity, especially when they're trading at the lower end of their five-year range. Metrics like that give a strong indication of where commodities might be heading. Carolyn Boroden of Fibonacci Queen says, "I have long-term support and timing in the silver markets because silver is a solid hedge on inflation. Plus, commodities like silver are tangible assets that people can hold onto."

The fundamentals of economics drive the price of commodities. As supply dips, demand increases and prices rise. Any disruption to a supply chain has a severe impact on prices. For example, a health scare to livestock can significantly alter prices as scarcity reins free. However, livestock and meat are just one form of commodities.

Metals, energy and agriculture are other types of commodities. To invest, you can use an exchange like the London Metal Exchange or the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, as well as many others. Often, investing in commodities means investing in futures contracts. Effectively, that's a pre-arranged agreement to buy a specific quantity at a specific price in the future. These are leveraged contracts, providing both big upside and a potential for large downside, so exercise caution.

###  Trade cryptocurrencies
Cryptocurrencies are on the rise. While trading them might seem risky, if you hedge your bets here as well, you could limit some fallout from a poorly-timed trade. There are plenty of platforms for trading cryptocurrencies as well. But before you dive in, educate yourself. Find courses on platforms like Udemy, Kajabi, or Teachable. And learn the intricacies of trading things like Bitcoin, Ether, Litecoin, and others.

While there are over 3,000 cryptocurrencies in existence, only a handful really matter today. Find an exchange, research the trading patterns, look for breakouts of long-term moving averages and get busy trading. You can use exchanges like [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/), [Kraken](https://www.kraken.com/), or [Cex.io](https://cex.io/), along with many others, to make the actual trades.

###  Use peer-to-peer lending
Peer-to-peer lending is a hot investment strategy these days. While you might not get rich investing in a peer-to-peer lending network, you could definitely make a bit of coin. Which lending platform do you use? Today, there are many to choose from, but the most popular ones include [Lending Club](https://www.lendingclub.com/) , [Peer Form](https://www.peerform.com/) , and [Prosper](https://www.prosper.com/) .

How does this work? Peer-to-peer lending platforms allow you to give small bursts of capital to businesses or individuals while collecting an interest rate on the return. You get more money than you would if you placed it in a savings account, plus your investment risk is limited because the algorithms are doing much of the hard work for you.

Once you identify the offer, you can dig in and do some research -- then, you can either take the deal or not. You'll have your risk evaluated based on a proprietary algorithm that includes employment and credit history, and you'll be able to decide to invest based on a variety of well-thought-out data.

###  Trade options
When it comes to a good investment option, Tom Sosnoff at Tastyworks says, "Trade small and trade often." What type should you trade? There are loads of vehicles, such as FOREX and stocks. The best way to make good money by investing when it comes to options is to jump in around 15 days before corporate earnings are released. What type should you buy? Money calls.
The optimal time to sell those money calls is the day before the company releases its earnings. There's just so much excitement and anticipation around earnings that it typically drives up the price, giving you a consistent winner. But don't hold through the earnings. That's a gamble you don't want to take if you're not a seasoned investor, says John Carter from [Simpler Trading](https://www.simplertrading.com/).

###  Flip real estate contracts
There are ways you can take as little as $500 to $1,000 and use the cash investments to flip real estate contracts to make quick money. How? Use a system like Kent Clothier's [REWW](https://reww.com/) to first understand how the market works.It'll then provide you with the data and tools to identify vacant homes, distressed sellers, and cash buyers.
While most people think that real estate is won by flipping traditional homes and doing the renovations yourself, the fastest money you can make in real estate involves flipping the actual contract itself. It's arbitrage. Identify the motivated sellers and cash buyers, bring them together, and effectively broker the deal. It might seem odd on the first go, but once you get the hang of it, you can become a mini-mogul in the real estate industry by simply scaling out this one single strategy. It works, and it's touted by some of the world's most successful real estate investors.
