#    Emotional Intelligence
##    It hurts when people you find attached departs.
Solutions.
*    Know people you get attached to. Its bad when you get attached to a person and that person doesn't feel the same.
*    Have friends who cares and appreciate your time and life and show care for you. If that's not the case probably not worth getting too close to that friend.
*    Must have friends. Its not easy to live without friends and family.
     *    Meet new people. All people you meet wont be a good friend for you. But you will come across some special ones.
     *    Try making new friends.
     *    If you don,t see friendship growing don't put too much effort into it, it will be followed by regret.
     *    Its okay good friends can be rare, there may not be a lot of people who would think the same way as you do.
*    Won't be a bad idea to think about marriage.

Don't worry too much:
*    Learn to care about yourself and prioritize your interests.
*    It doesn't matter what you do, if the person has no interest in you none of it has any affect, better use that effort for someone else. (compare the 2 p's)
*    Its not a good idea to derive your happiness from external factors.
*    You are happy your family & friends will also be happy.
*    Think beyond and think logically. Emotional decisions wont work not just professionally but in relationships too. Any decisions and approaches in life should be logical.
*    Be an opportunist, don't be shy.
*    Everything will pass.

##    Priya Case Study
###    
*    Its unlikely we will stay in touch once she leaves to Vancouver.
*    She would never go above and beyond to do any favors for myself.
*    Pretty sure I am giving unconditional attention.
*    Still don't think she is a person I want to help too much. Not a relationship that's going to last long.

#    Days of upset/lost sleep
##    Day:1 (22-12-14:Tuesday)
###    When/Situation
After taking Priya for drive.
I went to the gym after work as usual. Left the gym early as I was feeling tired. I was prepared to spend some time with Priya early from the day. I did like spending time with her anyways.
Called her from outside the gym, she was being friendly, picked her up at around 8. Went to the restaurant to grab food for myself. She was on the phone when I went into the rest room. She just wanted to go home for no reason after that.
Before dropping her home she said these few things during our short/not very nice conversation.
*    She felt a vibe at Vancouver that was never felt in Ontario.
*    She would never leave Vancouver
*    Hope her mother will find a guy in Vancouver
*    Her mother might be coming to stay this year
She really was in a hurry to leave, and I mentioned that I am going to be missing her, no reaction at all.
*    Big problem: I am reasoning a lot of things based of what she thinks. That's stupid.
###    Reason
Priya
*    Realizations
     *    Felt like she was comfortable ignoring as she left in a hurry not saying why. I did feel it rude.
          *    (Women are attention seekers, u have to give them attention, I didn't give her any) 
     *    She is not going to miss me
     *    She probably wont even remember my name in future
     *    Not seeing any room for the relation to grow.
###    Possible Causes
*    Lack of good friends/Not having a good partner
###    How long
From 9PM-2AM (lost sleep, totally wasn't worth it)
###    Remedy that helped
Realizing the fact that the thing that was actually upsetting me was Priya. Started thinking logically, what I could do and what's out of my reach, and things I should never care about.
*    Reason for upset was Priya behavior.
*    Expected a better friend from her but wasn't there.
*    Felt more like she would only talk when she needs something and she will talk very nice when that's the case.
*    Just driving sucks
*    The problem would have been solved if she talked nice at that moment.
     *    If she isn't I should not care much.
###    Remedy to try next time 
*    Think what actually the problem is. Only the fact and truth.
*    Find the solutions that would work.
*    See if any of those are possible or not in my hand.
*    If not in your hand, shit probably not worth it.
