#    Emotional Intelligence
##    It hurts when people you find attached departs.

Solutions.
*    Know people you get attached to. Its bad when you get attached to a person and that person doesn't feel the same.
*    Have friends who cares and appreciate your time and life and show care for you. If that's not the case probably not worth getting too close to that friend.
*    Must have friends. Its not easy to live without friends and family.
     *    Meet new people. All people you meet wont be a good friend for you. But you will come across some special ones.
     *    Try making new friends.
     *    If you don,t see friendship growing don't put too much effort into it, it will be followed by regret.
     *    Its okay good friends can be rare, there may not be a lot of people who would think the same way as you do.
*    Don't be a bad idea to think about marriage.


Don't worry too much:
*    Learn to care about yourself and prioritize your interests.
*    It doesn't matter what you do, if the person has no interest in you none of it has any affect, better use that effort for someone else. (compare the 2 p's)
*    Its not a good idea to derive your happiness from external factors.
*    You are happy your family & friends will also be happy.
*    Think beyond and think logically. Emotional decisions wont work not just professionally but in relationships too. Any decisions and approaches in life should be logical.
*    Be an opportunist, don't be shy.
*    Everything will pass.

###    Case Analysis
####    Before Vancouver
*    Used to meet during weekends
*    Didn't mention about the amazon interviews
*    she really hasn't mentioned about any interviews
*    Only met or talked for while dropping her or while grocery shopping.
*    Brought her a few times to Campbell and took back home.
*    Till now one word text only
*    One time she only called when she needed a ride to Campbell.
*    Hard to think she thought of me as anything more than a person who could help her with a few things and talk when meet in public.
*    Any nice things she said was only during driving, and wasn't followed with anything.
*    I was interested in spending time with her and taking her to the airport.
*    She was avoiding when she was spending time at the library. (reasons: not interested, hiding the interviews)
*    Couple of times she called are probably when she needed some help, or may be when extremely bored.
####    On and After Vancouver
*    she really didn't care anything about anyone in Windsor. Not even a little about myself.
*    She probably had interview and liked Vancouver and people much more than Windsor.
*    No doubt she hid things and hide things multiple times. (I cared for her, stupid to assume she had any)
*    She called after reaching Windsor. (reasons: aware that she only calls for help, lost the interview sad, feeling sad in general)
*    Although she wanted to know if I was mad, it is unlikely the reason for her calling had anything to do with fixing the friendship.
*    She called the day after for grocery, talked nice about me cooking her food.
*    I did the next day, she tried to avoid the conversation.
*    Couple of days talked to her, not much of talking. She was stressed so she spared some time. Unlikely she still had any interest in talking to me.
*    The day of graduation. Avoiding and the behavior. What Paul said most probably true.
*    Need i type more, things look just too obvious....
*    15 days
*    Bugging her for 2 weeks
*    Her birth day
*    gift
*    she didn't want to talk about her getting the job or any details
*    probably one of the last people she talked to.
*    Outcome of that call: she probably only care about the ride and help with driving test. 
*    Unlikely she will ask for, but if I present myself offering help she wouldn't say NO.

####    Conclusions
*    She never wanted to have a close friendship. (100%)
*    Nothing more than a contact she keeps with Eljo.
*    I could be trustful source for help in Windsor.
*    Unlikely she will ever contact me unless she need something from me.
*    Since we had that in one conversation, she will try to avoid that too, since she knows that I know what she is doing.
*    Of all these days if favor, she hasn't offered anything, not a thing for you.
*    I expected a lot from her, first a relationship then a good friend.
*    She only saw a friend during the phase she passes by. (100%)
*    She might have a realized I was expecting more and stayed aloof.
*    Don't judge by her border line character. 
####    Decision
*    She is not a friend, only and acquaintance.
*    Not a person you want to help beyond the boundary. She probably wont even see you as a friend.
*    Chapter closed.
*    What I need is to be better than her or anyone else, or be at peace.
*    Be good friends with people who actually cares for you. Its a waste of time otherwise
*    Let the people care for you, it doesn't work one way.
